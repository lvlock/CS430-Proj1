README

I had a lot of trouble with this project and am far from finishing. I started late
because I just have a heavy workload. But oh well... can't do anything about that now.
I also haven't been able to come to office hours to get help. So I really had a hard time
with this project.

I have been dealing with getting a gcc compiler to work all week. I have followed
several tutorials and uninstalled and reinstalled with Cygwin. GCC refuses to show up
in my cmd. So I can't test my code.

I also had a difficult time using Git and GitHub.
I had never used it before for any classes. So I followed tutorials, installed the Git 
software, and tried to learn it. I somehow screwed up my repository because the tutorials
weren't very clear to me. It wasn't allowing me to push changes to it all week. So today
I had to start over make a new repository.

I also don't know how to make or use a Makefile. Not sure what it is for. I've never created 
one before for any project in any class. I've never even heard it talked about. So my makefile 
is blank.

As far as my code goes. There's really nothing there. I spent too much time trying to deal with
all this software I needed to download that I didn't get much time to code.
